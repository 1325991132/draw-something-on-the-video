# draw-something-on-the-video

19 year's demo
It requires the writing and drawing functions of the iPad terminal to control the large screen
You can write and draw on the video, and since this requirement was previously used on the iPad, it's all supported by Touch events
If necessary, it can be modified by itself
You don't need a PHP environment to see the effect when you download it, and the content is fully commented

19年写的demo
要求使用ipad作为操控端进行写画，在大屏幕端呈现
在视频上可以写写画画，由于这个之前的需求是在ipad上使用的，所以其中支持的都是touch事件
有需要的可以自行修改
下载后无需php环境也可以看到效果，内容中有完整的注释
